# Final Project

## Overview

This project is focused on analyzing and modeling data using Python. The primary goal is to determine whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. The project involves data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and model building.

## File Structure

- `Final Project.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and analysis.
- `train.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
- `test.csv`: The dataset used for testing the model.

## Setup and Requirements

To run the notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- scipy

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open `Final Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.

## Functions

### `get_data()`

This function loads the training and testing data from specified paths and returns them as Pandas DataFrames.

- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: `train_d`, `test_d` - DataFrames containing training and testing data respectively.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Load the training and testing datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the data to understand distributions, relationships, and potential features for modeling.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Transform and create new features that might improve model performance.
5. **Model Building**: Train machine learning models to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.
7. **Prediction**: Use the final model to make predictions on the test dataset.

## Results and Conclusion

The results of the analysis and model performance will be detailed within the notebook. The conclusion will summarize the findings and suggest potential improvements or next steps.
