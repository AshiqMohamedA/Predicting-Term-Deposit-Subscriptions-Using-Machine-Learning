## Term Deposit Subscription Prediction
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features. The dataset consists of multiple client attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, and other financial indicators. The goal is to preprocess the data, handle outliers, encode categorical variables, and build a predictive model.

- warnings
- Install the dependencies using pip:

## bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy warnings
## Data Description
The dataset contains various features related to client information and their interaction with a bank's term deposit service. The target variable, subscribed, indicates whether a client subscribed to a term deposit.

## Features:
ID: Unique identifier for each client (dropped during preprocessing)
age: Age of the client
job: Type of job (encoded using one-hot encoding)
marital: Marital status (encoded using one-hot encoding)
education: Level of education (encoded using one-hot encoding)
default: Has credit in default? (encoded)
balance: Average yearly balance in euros
housing: Has housing loan? (encoded)
loan: Has personal loan? (encoded)
contact: Type of communication contact (encoded)
day: Last contact day of the month
month: Last contact month of the year (encoded numerically)
duration: Last contact duration in seconds
campaign: Number of contacts performed during this campaign
pdays: Number of days since the client was last contacted
previous: Number of contacts performed before this campaign
poutcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign (encoded)
subscribed: Target variable (1 = yes, 0 = no)
Code Description
The code performs the following steps:

## 1. Data Loading
The data is loaded from CSV files (train.csv and test.csv) using pandas.
The target variable subscribed is separated from the training data, and the datasets are combined for preprocessing.
## 2. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Rows with missing target values are dropped.
Handling Duplicates: Duplicate rows in the dataset are identified and handled.
Categorical Encoding:
Categorical variables such as job, marital, education, contact, etc., are encoded using one-hot encoding.
The month variable is mapped from categorical to numerical values (e.g., January = 1, February = 2, etc.).
Outlier Handling:
The Interquartile Range (IQR) method is used to handle outliers in the numeric columns such as age, balance, duration, and campaign.
Skewed columns are transformed using Yeo-Johnson transformation or Box-Cox transformation where applicable.
Feature Reduction: Highly correlated features are identified and removed based on a correlation threshold of 0.9.
## 3. Feature Engineering
Education Column Encoding: A custom encoding function is applied to combine the one-hot encoded education levels (primary, secondary, tertiary) back into a single column.
## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization:
Various plots such as histograms, box plots, and heatmaps are created to visualize data distributions and correlations.
Correlation Matrix:
A heatmap of the correlation matrix is generated to explore relationships between numeric variables.
## 5. Data Transformation
Yeo-Johnson Transformation: Applied to reduce skewness and normalize the distribution of several continuous variables.
Winsorization: Applied to the previous column to handle extreme values.
Plots and Visualizations
## The project includes the following visualizations:

Histograms: Visualize the distribution of numerical features.
Box Plots: Highlight outliers in numeric features.
Correlation Heatmap: Displays correlations between numeric features.
Distplots: Compare original and transformed distributions of skewed features.
How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:

## bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/term-deposit-prediction.git
cd term-deposit-prediction
Ensure Dependencies are Installed:

## bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Python Script:

## bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script will load the data, preprocess it, and perform exploratory data analysis.

## View the Visualizations:

The visualizations will be displayed as the code runs. These plots provide insights into the data, such as distribution and correlation.

## Future Enhancements
Model Building: After preprocessing, the next step would be to split the data into training and testing sets and build machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different models and tune hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to validate the model and prevent overfitting.
Model Deployment: Deploy the model using tools such as Flask, FastAPI, or streamlit to create a web application for predictions.
## Conclusion
This project preprocesses a bank marketing dataset, focusing on feature engineering, outlier handling, and data transformation. These steps prepare the data for modeling, enabling better predictive performance in the next stage of the project.
